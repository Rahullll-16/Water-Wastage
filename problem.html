            <h2>Water Wastage Statistics</h2>
            <!-- <p>Colleges waste millions of gallons of water each year. It's time to take action!</p> -->
             <p>While specific water wastage statistics for Lovely Professional University (LPU), a private university in Punjab, India, are not readily available in publicly accessible data, we can discuss general trends and practices related to water usage and wastage on college campuses like LPU. <br>

                LPU is one of the largest private universities in India, and its large campus, with thousands of students and staff, would likely face similar challenges as other major institutions when it comes to managing water resources. However, like many modern universities, LPU might have some water conservation measures in place. <br>
                
                Here are some insights into potential water wastage issues and conservation efforts that could apply to LPU: <br>
                
                1. <b>General Water Consumption at LPU </b> <br>
                <b>Large Campus with Multiple Facilities:</b> Given LPUâ€™s extensive infrastructure, including hostels, academic buildings, sports facilities, cafeterias, and large grounds, water consumption is likely to be substantial. As with other campuses, water usage would primarily be for drinking, bathrooms, canteens, sports complexes, and irrigation. <br>
                <b>Estimated Water Use:</b> A university like LPU could use anywhere between 10,000 to 50,000 gallons of water per day, depending on the number of students, faculty, and the activities on the campus. <br>
                2. <b>Key Areas of Water Wastage at LPU</b> <br>
                <b>Leaky Infrastructure:</b> As with many large campuses, old or poorly maintained plumbing systems can lead to significant water wastage. Even minor leaks in pipes, faucets, or toilets can result in considerable loss over time. <br>
                <b>Canteen Operations:</b> Large dining facilities and canteens are another significant area for potential water wastage. The cleaning of kitchens, utensils, and food preparation areas can consume large amounts of water. <br>
                <b>Watering of Green Spaces:</b> LPU is known for its vast and well-maintained green areas. If irrigation systems are not properly managed or optimized, they can lead to unnecessary water wastage, especially during the summer months. <br>
                <b>Hostels:</b> With many students residing on campus, the dormitories and hostel facilities can be a major area for water usage, particularly due to showers, toilets, and laundry services.</p>
